description: The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is an international non-profit
  digital rights group based in San Francisco in the United States. EFF provides funds
  for legal defense in court, presents amicus curiae briefs, defends individuals and
  new technologies from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose government
  malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and courts, organizes political
  action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve
  personal freedoms and online civil liberties, maintains a database and web sites
  of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential legislation that
  it believes would infringe on personal liberties and fair use, and solicits a list
  of what it considers patent abuses with intentions to defeat those that it considers
  without merit.
